# An-Image-Classification-Model-trained-on-CIFAR10-Dataset
A deep learning neural network that classifies among 10 different types of image categories based on the dataset.   
## Instructions:
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- If you have a dedicated GPU, install cuda libraries to make tensorflow faster.
- Run train.py using python train.py if you are running it for the first time. It will save a trained ML model named cifar10Model.h5, so that you don't have to train it again and again 
- This model will now be used by the gui.py file to classify images.
- Run gui.py using python gui.py
- The gui will be launched in a GUI interface created using Tkinter
